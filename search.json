    "text": "I trade options via Interactive Brokers and their Trader Workstation software. At a certain point, though, I realized their option chain interface did not alwasy show the last price a particular option traded at. Bid-ask info would be updated continuously, but not necessarily last price. I was then getting a false sense of what was actually happening at any given strike I might have been interested in. And the thing is, I pay for real-time data from the exchanges via IBKR, so there was no good reason to be seeing stale data.\nI remembered that Databento offers real-time OPRA data feeds, so I decided to sign up for that. It’s $199/mo, but I would argue it’s been totally worth it to see options order flow in real-time all throughout the trading day. You also get statistics once the exchanges close for the day.\nThis code sample doesn’t deviate much from the sample Databento offers to get you started with live data, but for a while this is what I used to watch real-time options order flow every weekday.\n\nimport databento as db\n\ndb.enable_logging(\"INFO\")\n\nsymbols = [\"GS    251219C00850000\",]\n\nlive_client = db.Live(API_KEY)\n\nlive_client.subscribe(\n    dataset = \"OPRA.PILLAR\",\n    schema = \"status\",\n    symbols = symbols,\n    stype_in = \"raw_symbol\",\n)\n\nlive_client.subscribe(\n    dataset = \"OPRA.PILLAR\",\n    schema = \"tcbbo\",\n    symbols = symbols,\n    stype_in = \"raw_symbol\",\n)\n\nlive_client.subscribe(\n    dataset = \"OPRA.PILLAR\",\n    schema = \"statistics\",\n    symbols = symbols,\n    stype_in = \"raw_symbol\",\n)\n\nlive_client.add_callback(print)\nlive_client.start()\n\nThis turned into:\n\n\n\nOPRA data flow from Databento in MacOS Terminal\n\n\nThe raw output from the feed is very hard to read and to follow what is happening with the options you’re interested in. In particular, the feed shows which option is which in the order flow via the instrument_id, but it’s a number, not a somewhat human-readable identifier (with issuer, date, and strike such as GS 251219C00850000). The feed gives you a listing of what instrument_id is tied to which option and strike, but that happens when the feed first launches. After that, there’s no easy way to know what you’re looking at. That calls for some modifications!"
